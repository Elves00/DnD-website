                style="float: left;">The sailboat
            arrives in a small coastal cave in a smuggling den. There's a storm
            a-brewing.<br>
            and our scoundrals are looking for a place to ride the night out. The group is carraying glass magic
            containment
            units for the local lord <b> Drazmire</b><br>
            Running the location is <b> Ekuza Baker</b> upon arrival they find a lively port inside a cave mouth. There
            are
            three main cabins two on next to the docking area and one on the far side of the came home to. <b>Francis
                Drake</b> and <b>Jim Rogers semi</b> who are semi permanant residents.<br>
            The group is intially greeted by the pair and here the story begins. <br>
            <p class="session">Upon arrival the group can see about 14 people milling about the cave. A black sloop
                currently loading up
                spices
                is the only other boat in the port and is owned by <b>Francis Drake</b>. There is a small shindig
                happening
                in
                the
                middle. Our group a Tortle two Tabaxi rouge and a druid human begin their adventure starting with the
                brothers
                stealing a health potion and some coins with a little magical assistance while our druid almost gets
                robbed
                by
                some people who spiked his drink. After retreating to their quarters for the night a bunch of undead
                Lizard
                folk
                sneaks into the cave led by a necromancer of some description. A stray shout wakes the two brothers, and
                they
                investigate running into one of the lizards and raising the alarm by way of combat. A fight ensues with
                one
                of
                the partygoers dying but everyone else escapes onto the two boats after <b>Francis Drake</b> shouts
                thereafter
                the
                item. The group leaves the cave having almost killed the necromancer and with 3 extra crew on board.
                They
                sail
                through the night and most of the morning before arriving at a small fishing village. They inform the
                local
                shipmaster of events before the session ends.</p>

            <!-- Paragraph of session 1 -->

            <h3 id="S2" class="sessionTitle">Session 2: Just here for a drink......</h3>
            <p class="session">After fleeing the cave the group continues on their journey before realizing they still
                need to resupply
                their
                ship. With this in mind, they head to the nearby small fishing village. Upon arrival, they are met by an
                old
                slightly large man in charge of the docks. The party notifies them of what happened at <b>Tabalath
                    Cove</b>
                the
                man was
                thankful and upon hearing the mention of <b>Lord Drazmire</b> he gives them a port birth. The group
                after
                docking heads
                off to resupply. Oogway enters the first bar he can find inside he finds a couple of patrons who he
                sells a
                spell to called magic hand for 10 silver. He then finds a stream to go and get water from. While Oogway
                sells
                this spell Luke and Boo Duke steal some moonshine from behind the bar luke attempts to go down to the
                back
                of
                the bar to look for more moonshine but requires a distraction. Boo tries to make a distraction by
                sneakily
                throwing a bottle however he was spotted and so a bar brawl begins within him in the midst tho he
                sneakily
                leaves. Using this confusion to his advantage Boo attempts to steal some money from the till.
                Unfortunately
                for
                him, a patron uninterested in the fight but very interested in buying another beer notices him stealing.
                As
                the
                man raises the alarm the mob turn and starts chasing him. Luke goes down to the cellar, finds a hidden
                room,
                and
                knocks out a man making drugs before stealing two crates of said drugs and two flagons of moonshine.
                <br>
                A little chase ensues with luke hiding the crates in the water before everyone regroups out of town to
                collect water. They collect the water and bring it back to town where the grand escape starts. The town
                is
                on
                full alert for the two Tabaxi to find them sneaking under the deck and so begins the massacre of two
                townsfolk
                in the duke brother’s escape path. Luke and Captain Fish make it to their boat and cast off before
                knocking
                a
                stowaway unconscious.
